        AMW 2024 will take place in the **National Autonomous University of Mexico** campus **Ciudad Universitaria** ("CU"), in Mexico City. 

        UNAM is a public university and one of the largest universities on the continent. Three Nobel laureates and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 25% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centres. 

        [**Ciudad Universitaria**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Universitaria,_Mexico_City) is UNAM main campus. It was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects and artists of the 20th century. It was named World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. Visits to Ciudad Universitaria often include the museums, the open areas, and the famous sculpture space, all part of the [UNAM Cultural Center](https://mexicocity.cdmx.gob.mx/tag/unam-cc/). The campus also hosted the main events of the [1968 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics).
