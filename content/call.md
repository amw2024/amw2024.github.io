Both extended abstracts and short papers will be published in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org). 

Papers should be written in English and formatted according to the LNCS Springer style for Lecture Notes in Computer Science. 

They must also be submitted electronically via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/TBD) in PDF format.
