        ### About

        AMW aims to cultivate and enhance expertise in database topics throughout the Latin American region. We are pleased to announce the launch of a grant program designed to support students and early-career scientists attending AMW 2024. These grants can be used to fund:

        * Partially or fully **travel and accommodation expenses**.

        ### Eligibility

        Grants will be awarded strongly emphasising diversity, equity, and inclusion aspects. Special consideration will be given to applicants from underrepresented groups, including those of diverse genders, indigenous backgrounds, and regions with limited access to opportunities.

        In line with AMW's mission, <mark>**we strongly encourage talented graduate students and early-career scientists based in Latin American institutions to apply** and seize this opportunity to further their expertise and career development</mark>.
