        AMW 2024 adheres to the [DB Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) initiative](https://dbdni.github.io/), which aims to guide researchers in our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset, in general, toward different individuals regardless of their age, gender, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, parental and marital status, etc. 

        During a conference, the initiative introduces several efforts to be more inclusive and equitable. Such efforts include providing an option for disability and special needs during registration and the necessary follow-up after registration, facilitating parenting support and child care, organising a mentorship lunch to foster interactions between senior and junior researchers, collecting and presenting examples of discriminatory behaviour and language, encouraging the organisation of a panel on minority experiences such as being female, junior, and belonging to a different ethnic/religious group, setting up a reporting board to list up concerns, suggestions, personal stories especially from minorities, and gathering feedback from attendees. 

        This initiative collaborates with the [DBCares team](https://dbdni.github.io/) following the [ACM policy against discrimination and harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and [ACM processes for reporting unacceptable behavior](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/reporting-unacceptable-behavior). Any participant who experiences abuse, discrimination, or harassment may contact any current member of the ADBIS Executive Board. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.

        ### Policies & Actions
